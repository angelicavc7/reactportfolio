          <p> I am 23 years old, currently studying Mechanical Engineering. I have now acquired new skills that not only have expanded my knowledge of software but also opened me up to a new world where the limitiations are beyond my own imagination. I am excited to continue learning and expanding my knowledge as a software developer, and challenge these new skills.</p>
